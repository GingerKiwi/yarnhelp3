        <h2>3.0 Version - Is Being Built in Public</h2>
        <p>This updated design and "DRYer" Javascript code is being built in public. Every day that I work on it, the updates will be deployed live. Note that I tend to use really bright colours like red and green for css testing purposes. That currently includes the links for this site. Take a look at the code here: <a href="https://github.com/GingerKiwi/yarnhelp3">GitHub repo for Yarn Help 3.0</a></p>
        <p>For the 2.0 version which has caluculations for worsted 04 weight (thickness) yarn for sweaters, scarfs, and blankets for both knit and crochet please visit <a href="https://yarnhelp2.netlify.app">https://yarnhelp2.netlify.app</a> </p>
