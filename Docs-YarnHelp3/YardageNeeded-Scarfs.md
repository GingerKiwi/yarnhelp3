## Yardage Needed

Note: **Yardage for scarfs is rounded up to the nearest 5 yards**

### Equation for Yardage Needed:

From [Twisted Yarn Shop](https://twistedyarnshop.com/blogs/news/q-a-how-much-yarn-do-i-need?_pos=1&_sid=6426a67a9&_ss=r)

- Formula: (length x width x gauge) / 6 = yards needed. 
	- Length and width are in inches and gauge is in stitches per inch. 
	- The division by 6 is to convert the answer from square inches to yards.Â 
- For example, if you'd like a scarf 48" long and 8" wide using a worsted weight yarn, (48 x 8 x 5) / 6 = 320 yards.
