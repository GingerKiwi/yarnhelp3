This is the orginal README.md for this project. I'm including it for my own records. Please see README.md in the main repo (up one folder level from here) for the current Readme. 

# yarn-gift-help-1.0
Inital version of The Yarn Gift Helper app - worsted/medium weight sweater.

The Yarn Gift Helper is designed to help non-knitters know how much yarn to gift the knitters in their life. 

With over 240,000 different yarns in the world*, many different thicknesses ("weights"), and yarn brands having different lengths of yarn in each ball/skein, it definately can be confusing.

Yarn Gift Helper is designed to help non-knitters quickly figure out how much yarn to buy for their family members and friends who are knitters - without spending hours learning about yarn. This current edition is just for pullover sweaters/jumpers made with medium thickness yarn. Over the next year (2022-2023), it will be expanded to include different weights (thickness) of yarn and different types of project (eg mitten and hat sets).


## CURRENT VERSION 1.0: 

This current initial release (1.0) of the Yarn Gift Helper has been quickly adapted in an afternoon from a Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path solo project (unit convertor). The inital idea for The Yarn Gift Helper popped into my head when I coded along with this codepen <https://codepen.io/bradtraversy/pen/jGNWey?editors=0010> by Brad Travesy and then refactored with Bootstrap 5 in early 2022.

## FUTURE VERSION(S) 2.0:

Accessibility and being able to view on a variety of device sizes are both important. The 2.0 release of The Yarn Gift Helper will be a redesign that includes a responsive layout, accessible first design, and most likely a dark/light theme switcher.

## Future Plans - Connecting to the Ravely.com api: 

The Yarn Gift Helper app will eventually connect to the Ravelry.com yarn database ("api") of 240,475 yarns so users can search by yarn name and have the yardage automatically inputted for them. When this happens and goes live depends on the time I have to develop this further.

## How the Number of Balls Needed is Calculated

-- HOW THE NUMBER OF BALLS NEEDED IS CALCULATED: -- //
The number of balls needed is calculated using the "max yardage" in <https://www.interweave.com/article/knitting/how-much-yarn-do-i-need/ > adding a 5% buffer ( * 1.05) and rounding up to the whole ball/skein (Math.ceil) because yarn is sold by the ball/skein and not fraction.
### Max Yardage for Pullover Sweater/Jumper
Baby: 550yards | Toddler: 800 yards | Child: 1200 yards | Adult small/medium or Women's: 1400 yards | Adult large/extra large or Mens's: 1700 yards

## Knitting is...

"Knitting is at its fundamentals, a binary code featuring top-down design, standardized submodules, and recursive logic that relies on ratios, mathematical principles, and an intuitive grasp of three-dimensional geometry." ~ Kim Salazar KnitList 1995"

## The Developer as a Knitter:

I've been knitting since I was six years old, and typically have one sweater on the go plus smaller sock, mitten, hat or other projects. I greatly enjoy multi-colour stranded knitting ("Fairisle") and cables. I firmly believe that anyone can learn to knit - but not everyone has to learn.
